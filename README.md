# Alcohol and Life Expectancy

## Project overview

**Study on the alcohol consumption by country, its GDP and life expectancy**

The purpose of this project is to analyze the impact of alcohol consumption in life expectancy by country and according to their gross domestic product (GDP) to see how different the impact can be, for example, the higher the GDP, the less impact on life expectancy.

We decided to make an analysis on this topic for its relevance to public health and be better informed about the negative effects of alcohol consumption, specially how it affects life expectancy. According to the World Health Organization, Alcohol has been classified as a Group 1 carcinogen, this is the highest risk group, which also includes asbestos, radiation and tobacco.

For this project we aim to analyze the relation between the gdp of each country, their alcohol consumption and life expectancy. We will try to answer whether the higher GDP, the lower the impact of alcohol consumption on life expectancy.

## Status of the project

We have defined the topic of the project, the reasons why we chose it, what we intend to answer with our data and we are currently in the process of exploring the dataset in order to discover what other answers the data could provide us. The next step is to include a machine learning model, confusion matrix and accuracy score.
